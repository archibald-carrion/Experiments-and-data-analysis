# Experiments and data analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data that I used in class of Design of Experiments (DoE), multiple dataset were used, goind from pokemon to network data. The goal of the experiments was to understand how to use DoE in different scenarios and how to analyze the data using different methods.
