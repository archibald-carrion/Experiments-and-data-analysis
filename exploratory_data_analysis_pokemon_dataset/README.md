# Exploratory data analysis Pokemon dataset
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Pokemon dataset

## Execution and Environment Setup

I project was developed using R and VSCode. The following packages are required to run the code:
```r
install.packages("dplyr")
```


In addition, to compile the project to PDF, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

It will generate a PDF file called pokemon_EDA.pdf in the root directory of the project.
